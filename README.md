# IoT-Data-Hackathon-2024
This repository contains the code and documentation for the Predictive Maintenance Solution developed during the IoT Data Hackathon 2024.
The project aims to optimize maintenance schedules for Hong Kong MTR's lifts and escalators by integrating IoT data and machine learning techniques.

### Features
Predictive Maintenance: Uses machine learning to predict potential failures and schedule maintenance proactively.
Data Integration: Combines IoT sensor data with historical maintenance records.
Visualization: Provides clear visual representations of data and maintenance schedules using Power BI.

### Tools and Technologies
**Google Colab**: For collaborative coding and data analysis. 

**Python**: Main programming language used.

**Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.

**Matplotlib**: For data visualization.

**BigQuery**: For handling large datasets.

**Power BI**: For creating interactive data visualizations.

### Usage
Upload the IoT sensor data to the data directory.
Run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory to preprocess the data and train the machine learning models.
Use the scripts in the scripts directory to integrate the models with the live data pipeline.
Visualize the results using the Power BI dashboard provided in the visualizations directory.
